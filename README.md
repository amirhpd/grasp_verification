# Embedded Deep Learning for Image-Based Grasp Verification

## Abstract
Artificial neural networks are assumed to be a solution to many modern 
computational problems. This branch of science is evolving quickly and finding its place in
many areas including embedded devices. According to recent advances in the area
of embedded and mobile devices, the possibility of implementing a neural network
algorithm on a small mobile device has been achieved.

This project studies the implementation of artificial neural networks on special
smart cameras that are able to perform on-board processing. Capabilities and
limitations of these smart cameras when they perform image classification are
investigated through this project. In order to do so, different experiments are
conducted and the results are compared to present a benchmark on these devices.
A robotic application of the introduced smart cameras is also studied. Particularly,
a visual-based grasp verification system is conducted and examined. Benefits and
problems of running deep learning algorithms on vision-based embedded devices in
real-world robotics are studied through the experiments. Besides, some approaches
to properly perform the experiments are introduced.
